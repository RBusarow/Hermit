 * Note that some implementations of `Resettable` are
 * lower maintenance (and therefore safer) than others.
 *
 * It's reasonably safe to implement `Resettable` when all state can be reset in a single
 * "nuclear" option, since future updates would automatically also be captured. On the
 * other hand, if each piece of state needs to be handled explicitly, then it is far
 * more likely that future additions state may forget to update the `reset` function.
